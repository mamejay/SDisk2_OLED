# SDISKII - Simplied version

This package contains a new version of the firmware for the SDISKII with OLED and
buttons to select the NIC image.

Images are saved in the card in NIC format. You can convert DSK to NIC and NIC to DSK
using the utility provided by Nishida in his webpage

     http://tulip-house.ddo.jp/digital/SDISK2/english.html

You can organize your images in subdirectories and you can nest them in as many levels
as you want. In order to save your configuration and keep track of your last mounted
NIC image and directory you need to have the SDISKII.CFG file saved in the top directory
of your SD card. Please use the SDISKII.CFG file provided in this repository.

## FIRMWARE

Note. this fork only support the OLED version, for LCD and Nokia Version, please refer to orignial repo.

  This is for the second version of the SDISK II done by Victor Trucco already with the
  128 x 64 OLED graphical display and USB connection to update the firmware.

## Formatting the SD card

You can use this version of the firmware with standard SD cards as well as with SDHC
cards. You can format them in FAT16 or FAT32 only. The minimum cluster size is 32kB
(or 64 blocks per cluster). In order to formar a SD card, use the command:

### Windows: (use windows 7 or older. Windows 10 does not work)

    format [letter:] /FS:FAT /A:32K

*you can replace FAT by FAT32.*

### MAC OS/X

    diskutil partitionDisk /dev/[disk name] MBR FAT16 SDISKII 0b
    diskutil umountDisk /deve[disk name]
    newfs_msdos -F 16 -c 64 /dev/[disk name]

*you can replace 16 (FAT16) by 32 (FAT32). The same for the partition scheme.*   
*64 is the number of blocks per cluster and can be larger.*

### Linux

    mkfs.msdos -F 16 -s 64 /dev/[disk name]

*you can replace 16 (FAT16) by 32 (FAT32).*   
*64 is the number of blocks per cluster and can be larger.*

## Selecting NIC image

When there is no disk activity (LED off), press the middle button (ENTER). A list
of NIC files in the current directory as well as the subdirectories, will be created.
Navigate through the list using the LEFT and RIGHT buttons. Use the ENTER button to
select a NIC file or a directory. Directories are shown around [ ].

**Only NIC files are supported.**

## Selecting the delay of the SD card

Standard SD and SDHC cards can differ by a large value in terms of speed. In order
to compensate it a little bit the user can set the delay of the card from 1 (small delays)
to 10 (long delays). The default value is 5 and it looks fine for the cards I testes.
If you get a lot of problems reading NIC file, try to change it a little. I noticed
that ProDOS images are more sensitive to this setting than DOS 3.3 images.

When there is no disk activity (LED off), press the LEFT button. The SDISKII will
prompt you to select the speed of the card. Use the LEFT and RIGHT buttons to
navigate the available speeds and the ENTER (middle) button to select it.

## Swap between two disk images

If you have the SDISKII.CFG file saved in your SD card (see bellow) we keep track of the
previous mounted NIC image. In this case, if you press the RIGHT button we swap the current
mounted NIC with the previous one. This may be useful if you are copying from one image to
another or if you are playing a game that spans over two images.

## Saving the default values and last NIC mounted

In order to save your configurations (SD card speed and last NIC mounted) you need
to copy the file SDISKII.CFG (provided here) in the root directory of your SD card.
If this file is not present every time you turn on the SDISKII the first found NIC
will be mounted and the speed of the SD card will be set to 5.

## Upgrading your SDISKII with this new firmware

In order to upgrade your SDISKII with this new firmware you will need a chip programmer, such
as the MiniPro TL866CS. Remove the ATMEGA328P from your SDISKII, plug it in the programmer.
Open the programmer software, load the firmware.

Check if the fuses are right. The values for the fuses are:

    LFUSE = 0xF7
    HFUSE = 0xF9
    EFUSE = 0xFF

then program your ATMEGA328P with this new firmware. Put it back to the SDISKII and you are set.
